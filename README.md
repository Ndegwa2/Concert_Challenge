This project implements a concert management system using SQLAlchemy for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping). It allows for the management of bands, venues, and concerts, showcasing their relationships and attributes.

Topics Covered
SQLAlchemy Migrations
SQLAlchemy Relationships
Class and Instance Methods
SQLAlchemy Querying
Database Schema
Bands Table
Column	Type
name	String
hometown	String
Venues Table
Column	Type
title	String
city	String
Concerts Table
The concerts table will be created with the following attributes:

A foreign key reference to the bands table.
A foreign key reference to the venues table.
A date column (String) to store the concert date.
Migrations
Before implementing the deliverables, ensure that migrations for the concerts table are created after migrating the bands and venues tables.

Migration Steps
Create a migration for the concerts table that establishes relationships with the bands and venues tables.
Add a date column to the concerts table.
Deliverables
Object Relationship Methods
Implement the following methods in your classes:

Concert
band(): Returns the Band instance for this concert.
venue(): Returns the Venue instance for this concert.
Venue
concerts(): Returns a collection of all the concerts for the venue.
bands(): Returns a collection of all the bands who performed at the venue.
Band
concerts(): Returns a collection of all the concerts that the band has played.
venues(): Returns a collection of all the venues that the band has performed at.
Ensure these methods are functioning correctly by testing with sample data.

Aggregate and Relationship Methods
Concert
hometown_show(): Returns true if the concert is in the band's hometown, otherwise false.
introduction(): Returns a string introducing the band for this concert in the format:
arduino
Copy code
"Hello {insert venue city}!!!!! We are {insert band name} and we're from {insert band hometown}"
Band
play_in_venue(venue, date): Takes a Venue instance and a date (as a string) as arguments; creates a new concert for the band in that venue on that date.

all_introductions(): Returns an array of strings representing all introductions for this band.

most_performances(): Class method that returns the Band instance for the band that has played the most concerts.

Venue
concert_on(date): Takes a date (string) as an argument and returns the first concert on that date at that venue.
most_frequent_band(): Returns the band with the most concerts at the venue.
Testing
After implementing the classes and methods, create instances and use SQLAlchemy sessions to verify that the relationships and methods function as expected. You can query the database to test the relationships, such as checking that session.query(Band).first().venues returns the correct venues.

Conclusion
This project provides a structured approach to managing bands, venues, and concerts using SQLAlchemy. The defined relationships and methods facilitate easy querying and manipulation of data, enabling effective concert management.
